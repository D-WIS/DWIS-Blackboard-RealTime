# DWIS Blackboard Rig Edition: real-time process

Part of DWIS Blackboard Rig Edition (GitHub topic `dwis-blackboard-rig-edition`); design and decisions in [DWIS-Blackboard-Design](https://github.com/D-WIS/DWIS-Blackboard-Design).

**Holds:** the real-time process: `DWIS.RealTime.Core` (no OPC UA dependency), the OPC Foundation adapter, the method façade, the hub role, unit tests, the Dockerfile.

**Produces:** image `digiwells/dwis.blackboard.realtime`.

**Depends on:** `DWIS-Blackboard-Contracts`; the existing `DWIS.API.DTO` and OPC UA schema packages from `DWIS-Blackboard-Base`.

## Status

Created in milestone 1; the code and the full pipeline arrive in milestone 4. Until then the pull request workflow only builds what exists and scans dependencies.

## How to work here

Trunk-based (specification 10.2 in the design repository): branch from `main` as `feature/…`, `fix/…` or `chore/…`, open a pull request early, one approval and green CI, squash merge. Releases are git tags `vX.Y.Z[-alpha.N]` on `main`. The Blackboard API stays at version 2; Rig Edition artefacts start at 1.0.0.

Work items live as issues with milestones M1 to M6 and are tracked on the organisation project [Rig Edition](https://github.com/orgs/D-WIS/projects/5).
